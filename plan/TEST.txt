In order to set up an initial Phantom user in both the Autoscale API and the
web application, you must export the following environment variables:

    PHANTOM_USERNAME
    PHANTOM_USER_EMAIL
    PHANTOM_IAAS_ACCESS_KEY
    PHANTOM_IAAS_SECRET_KEY

The test.conf launch plan will create a user account with these
credentials. It will also create an SSH key on the VM and register it on
the FG clouds if there is not already one called phantomkey.
